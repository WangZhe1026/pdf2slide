# pdf2slide

If you don't have a PDF reader but still want to convert PDF to pptx format, use it.

It is able to convert PDF to slide by Python （avoiding format problems but losing the original LaTeX's built-in navigation and other functions）

If you don't care about the arrangement problems and still want to use these functions (such as navigation bar), there are many free online tools to choose.

## environments
```
pip install PyMuPDF
pip install python-pptx
```
## demo
Here are two PDFs to compare the output effects.
